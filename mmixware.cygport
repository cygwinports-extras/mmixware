SUMMARY="MMIX simulators, assembler, and tools"
DESCRIPTION="MMIX is a computer intended to illustrate machine-level aspects
of programming. In the books The Art of Computer Programming, it replaces MIX,
the 1960s-style machine that formerly played such a role.  MMIX was designed
so that its machine language would be simple, elegant, and easy to learn. At
the same time it includes all of the complexities needed to achieve high
performance in practice, so that MMIX could in principle be built and even
perhaps be competitive with some of the fastest general-purpose computers in
the marketplace."
